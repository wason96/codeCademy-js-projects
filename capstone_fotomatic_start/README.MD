# Responsive Website Project

This is a project for CodeCademy's Front-End Engineer career path.

I was given a [basic site](./before.png) that's broken and had to apply what I've learned to the moment and/or research to fix it and end with a website made according to the [required specs](./fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png).

Initial commit includes the base files provided + _this Readme_, the _before_ image, and the _Specs_.
